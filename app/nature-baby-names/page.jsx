  {
    q: 'What are nature baby names?',
    a: 'Nature names are drawn from the natural world \u2014 plants, trees, flowers, weather, landscapes, seasons and celestial bodies. They range from long-established names such as Rose, Hazel and Iris to modern choices such as Wren, Juniper and Atlas.',
  },
  {
    q: 'Are nature names suitable for boys and girls?',
    a: 'Many are. Flower names such as Rose, Lily and Violet are mostly given to girls in the US, while several nature names \u2014 Rowan, Sage, River, Wren \u2014 are used for both boys and girls. SSA publishes counts by sex if you want to check a particular name.',
  },
  {
    q: 'Do nature names have meanings beyond the obvious?',
    a: 'Often, yes. Many plant and tree names carry symbolic associations that predate their use as names, and several have separate documented meanings in different traditions. Our profiles record the meaning we hold for each name rather than assuming the literal plant name is the whole story.',
  },
  {
    q: 'Which nature names are already common?',
    a: 'Several are mainstream. Violet, Aurora and Lily are in SSA\u2019s girls\u2019 top 20 for babies born in 2025, and BabyCenter\u2019s in-progress 2026 table also has Hazel, Luna, Willow, Nova, Iris and Ivy in its top 40. Longer botanical names such as Magnolia and Camellia rank much lower, which makes them better picks if you want a nature name that is not already common.',

          Choosing a nature name
        </h2>
        <div className="prose-nv mt-4 max-w-3xl">
          <p>
            Nature names have an unusual property: their literal meaning is visible to everyone. That
            makes them easy to explain and hard to hide. A child named Juniper will be asked about the
            tree; a child named Atlas will be asked about the myth. Neither is a problem, but it is a
            different experience from a name whose meaning is buried in etymology.
          </p>
          <p>
            The second thing to weigh is how crowded the group has become. Botanical and celestial names
            have moved into the mainstream quickly, and several of the most attractive options are now
            common. If rarity matters, the productive zone is the longer botanical names and the less
            familiar constellations \u2014 Magnolia, Camellia, Zinnia, Corvus, Aquila.
          </p>
          <p>
            Finally, check the name&rsquo;s documented meaning rather than assuming it. Several nature
            names carry a traditional meaning that differs from the literal reading, and a few have
            distinct meanings in different traditions. Our{' '}
