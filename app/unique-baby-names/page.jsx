That is a deliberately practical definition: it excludes names that are merely unfamiliar to one reader but common in the published lists we compare.',
  },
  {
    q: 'Will a unique name cause problems for my child?',
    a: 'The practical risks are spelling and pronunciation, not the name itself. Profiles show a pronunciation guide and recorded spelling variants where the record holds them, so you can check both before committing. Names with a clear phonetic structure travel better than names that require an explanation every time.',
  },
  {
    q: 'How can I check how rare a name really is?',
    a: `Look it up in the Social Security Administration data for the latest birth year. SSA publishes the top 1,000 names with counts, and those covered about ${Math.round(SSA_TOP_1000_SHARE_2025.total)}% of babies born in 2025 \u2014 so a name outside the top 1,000 is genuinely uncommon nationally. Names given to fewer than five babies in a year are not published at all, for privacy.`,
  },
  {
    q: 'Are rare names harder to research?',
    a: 'They can be, which is why we only list names we hold a documented meaning and origin for. A rare name with no documented meaning is a name you cannot explain to your child later, and we do not publish those.',

          How we define &ldquo;unique&rdquo;
        </h2>
        <div className="prose-nv mt-4 max-w-3xl">
          <p>
            &ldquo;Unique&rdquo; is a word that means very little on its own. A name can be unique to
            one family and common in another country, or rare nationally and ordinary in one state. So
            we anchor the definition to something checkable: a name qualifies for this page if it has a
            documented meaning and origin in our database and does <strong>not</strong> appear in the
            national or independent ranking lists used by this guide.
          </p>
          <p>
            That is a practical test rather than a strict one: a name outside these short lists can still be
            fairly common, so check a favourite against SSA&rsquo;s full top 1,000 before you call it rare. The
            list also changes as the rankings move \u2014 when a name enters one of those lists, it leaves this
            page, so the definition stays consistent over time.
          </p>
          <p>
            The second filter is documentation. We only list names we can explain. A rare name with no
            documented meaning is a name you cannot tell your child about later, and publishing those
            would make this page longer without making it more useful.
          </p>
