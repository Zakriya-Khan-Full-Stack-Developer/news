const FAQS = [
  {
    q: 'What is a gender-neutral baby name?',
    a: 'A gender-neutral name is one that is given to boys and girls in meaningful numbers, rather than being strongly associated with one. Some names are neutral by origin, others become neutral over time as usage shifts \u2014 which is why neutrality is a moving property rather than a fixed category.',
  },
  {
    q: 'Do gender-neutral names stay neutral?',
    a: 'Not always. A name that is balanced today can become strongly associated with one gender later, as usage shifts. SSA publishes US counts by sex for every name given to at least five babies a year, so you can check a name\u2019s current balance rather than relying on its reputation.',
  },
  {
    q: 'Are unisex names a modern invention?',
    a: 'No. Many names now treated as neutral have centuries of use behind them, and in several traditions names were never gender-marked in the first place. What is modern is the deliberate choice of a neutral name, not the names themselves.',
  },
  {
    q: 'How many gender-neutral names does NameVerse list?',
    a: 'About 1,000 published profiles are classified as unisex in their source records across the three traditions we cover. That is the record\u2019s classification, not a measurement of how often each name is given to boys and girls. This page shows a spread of them across the alphabet; the search page can filter the full set.',

          How names drift between genders
        </h2>
        <div className="prose-nv mt-4 max-w-3xl">
          <p>
            Gender association is not a property a name has; it is a pattern in how people use it, and
            patterns move. A name can be evenly split for a generation and then tip decisively one way
            once it becomes fashionable for that gender.
          </p>
          <p>
            This matters practically. If you choose a neutral name because you want it to stay neutral,
            the useful question is not &ldquo;is this name unisex?&rdquo; but &ldquo;which direction is
            its usage moving?&rdquo; A name that is 60/40 today and drifting is a different choice from
            one that has held near 50/50 for decades. In the US you can answer that from SSA&rsquo;s published
            counts by sex and year.
          </p>
          <p>
            The second thing worth knowing is that neutrality is cultural, not universal. A name that is
            firmly one gender in one language can be neutral in another, and families naming across two
            traditions often find that the same name reads differently in each. Our{' '}
