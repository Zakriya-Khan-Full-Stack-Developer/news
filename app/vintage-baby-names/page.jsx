  {
    q: 'What are vintage baby names?',
    a: 'Vintage names are names that were common in earlier generations, fell out of fashion, and are now being used again. The clearest examples are names that peaked in the late nineteenth or early twentieth century and had become rare by the 1990s \u2014 Eleanor, Theodore, Mabel, Walter, Hazel, Arthur.',
  },
  {
    q: 'Why are vintage names popular again?',
    a: 'Two reasons. First, they are recognisable without being crowded: a name that was common a century ago is familiar to everyone but rare in a modern classroom. Second, they carry a sense of continuity, which matters to parents choosing a name with family or cultural weight.',
  },
  {
    q: 'Are vintage names the same as classic names?',
    a: 'Not quite. A classic name has been in continuous use \u2014 Elizabeth, James, William. A vintage name went away and came back. The distinction matters because a revival can become very common: check a vintage name\u2019s latest SSA rank before assuming it is rare.',
  },
  {
    q: 'Which vintage names are already common?',
    a: 'Several revivals are now firmly mainstream. In SSA\u2019s ranking for babies born in 2025, Charlotte is No. 2 for girls, Theodore No. 4 and Henry No. 5 for boys, Evelyn No. 8 and Eleanor No. 12 for girls. Harder-edged Victorian names such as Percival and Archibald are much rarer choices in the US.',

          Why vintage names return
        </h2>
        <div className="prose-nv mt-4 max-w-3xl">
          <p>
            Naming fashion runs in roughly century-long cycles. A name that was everywhere in 1900
            becomes unfashionable by 1950, feels dated by 1980, and by 2020 has lost its association
            with any living generation. At that point it stops sounding old and starts sounding
            distinctive \u2014 which is exactly when it comes back.
          </p>
          <p>
            The mechanism is generational rather than aesthetic. A name is only &ldquo;old-fashioned&rdquo;
            while the people who bore it are still around to be associated with it. Once that
            association fades, what is left is the name&rsquo;s sound and its meaning, and many of these
            names have both in abundance.
          </p>
          <p>
            There is a practical consequence worth knowing. The soft, vowel-ending revivals are already
            well into the mainstream \u2014 Theodore was the No. 4 boy name for babies born in 2025 \u2014
            while the harder Victorian names, and the ones tied to a specific historical figure, remain
            rarer. Our{' '}
