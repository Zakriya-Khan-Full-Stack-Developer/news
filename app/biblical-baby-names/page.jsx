  {
    q: 'Are biblical names Hebrew in origin?',
    a: 'Most of the names in the Hebrew Bible are, but not all. The biblical corpus also includes Aramaic, Greek and Latin names, and many biblical names reached English through Greek and Latin transliteration rather than directly from Hebrew. That is why the same name can have several distinct recorded forms.',
  },
  {
    q: 'What is the difference between a biblical name and a Christian name?',
    a: 'A biblical name appears in scripture. A Christian name is one used within Christian tradition, which includes biblical names but also the names of saints and later devotional names that do not appear in the Bible at all. Our database records both, and marks which is which.',
  },
  {
    q: 'Do biblical names have to be traditional?',
    a: 'No. Many biblical names are short, modern-sounding and easy to spell \u2014 Levi, Asher, Ezra, Noah, Eli. The perception that biblical names are heavy or old-fashioned does not match how they are actually used today.',

          Choosing a biblical name
        </h2>
        <div className="prose-nv mt-4 max-w-3xl">
          <p>
            The biblical corpus is unusually deep, which is both its appeal and its difficulty. It
            contains names that are now thoroughly mainstream \u2014 Noah, Elijah, Hannah, Abigail
            \u2014 and names that have barely been used in English for centuries. The range means you can
            choose a biblical name that is common, or one that almost nobody shares, without leaving the
            tradition.
          </p>
          <p>
            The most useful distinction when choosing is between a name&rsquo;s scriptural weight and
            its everyday usability. A name like <strong>Malachi</strong> or <strong>Josiah</strong>{' '}
            carries a clear scriptural identity and is still straightforward to say and spell. A name
            like <strong>Nebuchadnezzar</strong> carries more weight than most families want to place on
            a child. Both are biblical; only one is practical.
          </p>
          <p>
            It is also worth checking the name&rsquo;s recorded forms. Many biblical names reached
            English through Greek and Latin rather than directly from Hebrew, which is why the same name
            can appear as several distinct spellings. Our profiles list the variants we hold, so you can
            see how much spelling variation you would be taking on. For the wider tradition, our{' '}
