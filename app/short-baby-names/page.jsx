    q: 'What are the shortest baby names?',

  },
  {
    q: 'Why are short baby names so popular?',
    a: 'They are easy to spell, easy to pronounce across languages, and they fit well with long surnames. Several sit near the top of the US ranking: for babies born in 2025, Mia was No. 6 and Ava No. 11 for girls, and Jack No. 15 and Leo No. 19 for boys (SSA).',
  },
  {
    q: 'Do short names have less meaning?',
    a: 'No. Length and meaning are unrelated. Many short names carry substantial meanings, and several double as short forms of longer names \u2014 Eli is a biblical name in its own right that also shortens Elijah, Mia began as a diminutive of Maria, and Leo is Latin for \u201clion\u201d as well as a short form of Leonard. Our profiles record the meaning we hold for each.',
  },
  {
    q: 'Are short names good for bilingual families?',
    a: 'Often, yes. Short names with simple phonetics tend to survive translation better than long ones, because there is less to adapt. Names built from sounds that exist in both languages \u2014 Kai, Leo, Mia, Zoe \u2014 usually need no adjustment at all.',

          Why short names are winning
        </h2>
        <div className="prose-nv mt-4 max-w-3xl">
          <p>
            The current US top 10 is almost entirely one and two syllable names, and the reason is
            practical rather than aesthetic. A short name is faster to say, easier to spell, and less
            likely to be shortened by other people into something you did not choose. It also survives
            translation better, which matters in a country where a large share of families name across
            two languages.
          </p>
          <p>
            There is a second effect worth knowing about. Short names are more likely to be unisex,
            because a name with fewer phonetic markers carries less gender information. That makes the
            short-name list a productive place to look if you want a neutral name \u2014 Kai, Ari, Noa,
            Remi, Wren and Sage all sit in both categories.
          </p>
          <p>
            The trade-off is crowding. Because short names are popular, the best-known ones are common.
            If you want a short name that is not already everywhere, the productive zone is the less
            familiar three-letter names and the short forms of longer traditional names \u2014 Cleo, Juno,
            Rhea, Zora, Ira, Gus. Our{' '}
